# REAL MCP Integration Plan

## What We Currently Have (FAKE):
- Python class called "EnhancedPlaywrightMCP" 
- Direct Playwright calls in Python
- Web server endpoints
- `use_real_mcp` flag that does nothing

## What REAL MCP Integration Requires:

### 1. Microsoft Playwright MCP Server (Node.js)
```bash
# Install the REAL Playwright MCP server
npm install -g @microsoft/playwright-mcp
# Or use npx
npx @microsoft/playwright-mcp
```

### 2. MCP Client Integration
- VS Code with MCP extension
- Claude Desktop with MCP config
- Or custom MCP client following the protocol

### 3. JSON-RPC Protocol Communication
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "playwright_navigate",
    "arguments": {
      "url": "https://example.com"
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### 4. Inter-Process Communication
- stdio (stdin/stdout)
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- WebSocket connections

## Current Status: ðŸš« COMPLETELY FAKE
We're just calling Python Playwright directly and pretending it's MCP.

## To Make It Real:
1. Install Node.js Playwright MCP server
2. Create MCP client in Python to communicate via JSON-RPC
3. Bridge Python AI logic â†’ MCP protocol â†’ Node.js Playwright
4. Handle async communication properly
